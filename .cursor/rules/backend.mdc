### Backend and Database

- Use Supabase for backend services, including authentication and database interactions.
- Follow Supabase guidelines for security and performance. 
- Use Zod schemas to validate date exchanged with the backend. 
- Use SupabaseClient type from 'src/db/supabase.client.ts', not from '@supabase /supabase-js'.
