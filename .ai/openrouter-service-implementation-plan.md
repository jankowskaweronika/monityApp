# OpenRouter Service Implementation Plan

## 1. Service Description

The OpenRouter service is designed to integrate with the OpenRouter API to enhance chat functionalities using LLM-based interactions. It facilitates secure communication, message handling, response formatting, and model configuration.

## 2. Constructor Description

The constructor initializes the API client, message handler, response formatter, and model configuration manager. It sets up necessary configurations and authenticates with the OpenRouter API.

## 3. Public Methods and Fields

- **sendMessage(userMessage: string): Promise<Response>**
  - Sends a user message to the OpenRouter API and returns a structured response.
- **configureModel(modelName: string, parameters: object): void**
  - Configures the model and its parameters for subsequent API interactions.

## 4. Private Methods and Fields

- **\_createSystemMessage(): string**

  - Constructs a system message with necessary metadata.

- **\_formatResponse(apiResponse: any): any**
  - Formats the API response into a structured format using JSON schema validation.

## 5. Error Handling

- **Network Errors**: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff.
- **API Errors**: Log errors and provide user-friendly messages.
- **Validation Errors**: Validate inputs and outputs against predefined schemas.

## 6. Security Considerations

- Use HTTPS for secure communication.
- Implement token-based authentication.
- Validate all inputs and outputs to prevent injection attacks.

## 7. Step-by-Step Deployment Plan

1. **Setup Environment**: Ensure Node.js and npm/yarn are installed. Configure environment variables for API keys and model settings.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Use the package manager to install necessary libraries and tools.
3. **Initialize Service**: Create an instance of the service and configure initial settings.
4. **Implement Message Handling**: Define system and user message structures and implement message processing logic.
5. **Configure Model**: Set up model names and parameters using a configuration file or environment variables.
6. **Integrate with OpenRouter API**: Implement API client methods to send and receive messages.
7. **Implement Error Handling**: Add error handling logic for network, API, and validation errors.

This implementation plan is tailored to the MonityApp's tech stack and includes best practices for error handling and security. Follow the instructions to ensure a smooth deployment of the OpenRouter service.
